        Estimate apprenticeships you could fund

          <p class="lede">The figures below show the forecast funds that will be available to you for the duration of your apprenticeships.</p>

<p>These figures are based on the current information in your account and the data provided by your training provider which is used to calculate funding.  The table shows the monthly projection figures until April 2022.</p>

<p>Once you have your forecast of funds, you can estimate how many apprenticeships you could fund in the future - either by transferring any remaining funds to another employer, or by taking on more apprentices yourself.</p>

                        <p>This tool is designed to illustrate what your funds may look like based on the apprenticeships currently in your apprenticeship service account and the funding band maximum for the estimated apprenticeships you have added, using this estimator.</p>
                        <p> The actual amount of funds available is likely to vary if there are any changes made to your apprenticeship arrangements, including, for example, changes in the number of apprentices employed, or the cost and duration of their training. </p>
                        <p>You should therefore not rely solely on the information provided by this tool when making decisions about the transfer of funds.</p>
