<p>This prototype shows the re-ordering of the columns in the projection to reflect the order in which payments are taken out through the month. The initial items are payments out on the 5th followed by levy paid in later around the 20th. This will help when co-investment figures are paid against balances that dip below 0 in the month but raise above again as levy is paid in.</p>
